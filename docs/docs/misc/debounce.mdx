# `debounce`

export const meta = {
  category: 'Misc',
  title: 'debounce',
};

Returns _debounced_ version of given function.
The result function, when called, will only call the original function when `timeout` is reached.

The most common place to use debounces in the frontend is a request to the server when entering characters in the search field

```ts
import { debounce } from '@krutoo/utils';

function filterSuggestions(query) {
  // ...suggestion request
}

const handleInput = debounce(event => {
  filterSuggestions(event.target.value);
}, 500);

// filterSuggestions will be executed 500ms after user has stopped typing
field.addEventListener('input', handleInput);
```
