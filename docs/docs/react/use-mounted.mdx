# `useMounted`

export const meta = {
  category: 'React',
  title: 'useMounted',
};

> Also known as `useIsClient/useIsBrowser` etc...

Returns `true` after component is mounted (on client side), `false` otherwise. Useful for creating SSR ready UI.

### Usage

```tsx
import { useMounted } from '@krutoo/utils/react';

function App() {
  const mounted = useMounted();

  return mounted ? <PageContent /> : <LoadingSpinner />;
}
```

### Why is naming a hook "useIsClient/useIsBrowser" wrong?

This is because with right implementation you will receive `false` on first render on client (in browser) but actually your code already runs on client.

Wrong implementation will return `true` exactly when code runs on client but it is not SSR friendly because result is unstable between server and client.

Here is an example of hook that is bad for SSR:

```ts
export function useIsClient() {
  return typeof window !== 'undefined';
  // or return typeof document !== 'undefined';
  // etc.
}
```
