# `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect`

export const meta = {
  category: 'React',
  title: 'useIsomorphicLayoutEffect',
};

Works as `useLayoutEffect` on client side and as `useEffect` on server side.

Needs just for avoid warnings like:

> Warning: useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server

Helps to make your components SSR ready.

```tsx
import { useIsomorphicLayoutEffect } from '@krutoo/utils/react';
```
