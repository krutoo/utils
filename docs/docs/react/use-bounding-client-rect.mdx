# `useBoundingClientRect`

export const meta = {
  category: 'React',
  title: 'useBoundingClientRect',
};

React hook of state of bounding client rect of element.

State will be automatically updated on:

- element resize
- element position change (relative to viewport)

```tsx
import { useBoundingClientRect } from '@krutoo/utils/react';

export function App() {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  // you can use bounds rectangle of element
  const rect = useBoundingClientRect(ref);

  return <div ref={ref}>Hello!</div>;
}
```

### Force update

This hook uses next sources to update state:

- it listens `scroll` event on document
- it create `ResizeObserver` on target element

However, tracking absolutely all actions that lead to a change in the size or position
of an element is a difficult task.

For example your element can have _css transition_ on hover.

You can force hook to update state by calling `forceUpdate` method on returned object.
